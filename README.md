PlantVillage Disease Detection using YOLOv8
A deep learning-based web application for real-time plant disease detection using the YOLOv8 object detection model trained on the PlantVillage dataset.
Project Overview:
Plant diseases can severely affect crop yield and quality. This project leverages YOLOv8, a state-of-the-art object detection model from Ultralytics, to classify and localize plant leaf diseases from images using the PlantVillage dataset.
It is deployed on Hugging Face Spaces with Gradio for easy and interactive usage.
