This project implements a YOLOv8 object detection model trained on the PlantVillage dataset to identify plant diseases from leaf images. It includes a Gradio-powered web interface that allows users to upload images and view real-time predictions, making it suitable for research demos, practical deployment, or showcasing computer vision skills.
